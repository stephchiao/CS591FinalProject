# CS591 MEAN stack Final Project

# Running
Clone the repo and install node and passport with `npm install`. Start mongoDB with `mongod&`, then run the app with `npm start`.

# Deliverables
This project is a recipe searching app. The main feature is searching for recipes. When a search query is made, the list of results shows the recipe name, recipe id (from the Spoonacular API), and how many calories one serving contains. If a user is logged in, they can add searched recipes to their favorites and delete recipes from their favorites. The webapp also shows a list of workouts to do after your meal (how handy!). 

The web app uses two APIs. Requests to the Spoonacular API are used for searching recipes and the wger API is used to produce a list of exercises.

# APIs
Spoonacular API: https://market.mashape.com/spoonacular/recipe-food-nutrition

wger API: https://wger.de/en/software/api
